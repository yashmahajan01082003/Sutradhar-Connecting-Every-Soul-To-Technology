## Inspiration  

1.3 billion people are forced to adapt to technology that was never designed for them.  
We wanted to flip that reality — and build technology that adapts to people, regardless of disability, age, or literacy level.

## What it does  

Sutradhar is an AI-powered unified accessibility ecosystem.  
It combines voice-first assistance, AI indoor navigation, gesture controls, multilingual support, text-to-sign & sign-to-text conversion, smart detection hardware, and caregiver integration — all in one platform.

## How we built it  

We built Sutradhar using Next.js + Flask with a modular AI architecture.  
We integrated our published indoor navigation algorithm, a lightweight 1-bit LLM for resource-efficient AI, and affordable smart hardware prototypes.  
Each feature works as a module within one seamless interface.

## Challenges we ran into  

- Designing for multiple impairments without complicating the UI  
- Making AI efficient for low-resource devices  
- Keeping hardware affordable  
- Balancing personalization with simplicity  

## Accomplishments that we're proud of  

- Published indoor navigation research (IEEE ICACCTech 2024)  
- Built a purpose-specific 1-bit LLM  
- Developed a working modular prototype  
- Designed a cost-effective smart stick  
- Created an end-to-end unified accessibility vision  

## What we learned  

- Accessibility must be an ecosystem, not a feature  
- Simplicity requires deep design thinking  
- Inclusion demands personalization  
- Scalability depends on affordability  

## What's next for Sutradhar: Connecting Every Soul To Technology  

- Pilot programs with NGOs and institutions  
- Enhance neuromorphic brainwave interface  
- Expand multilingual AI support  
- Launch freemium + institutional licensing model  
- Scale toward our first 100,000 users
